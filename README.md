# 2048 Game with React, TypeScript, and Zustand

Welcome to my implementation of the classic 2048 game using React, TypeScript, and Zustand! This project is a fun and interactive way to practice your coding skills while enjoying a challenging game.

## Description

2048 is a classic puzzle game in which the player slides numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when the player creates a tile with the number 2048, but the challenge comes from the limited space and the need to strategically combine tiles to reach the goal.

This implementation of the game uses React for the user interface, TypeScript for type checking, and Zustand for state management. The code is well-organized and easy to read, making it a great learning resource for anyone looking to improve their coding skills.

## How to Start the Project

To start the project, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Install dependencies by running npm install.
3.Start the development server by running npm start.
4.Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the game in action.
That's it! You should now be able to play the 2048 game on your local machine. Have fun!
